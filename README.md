Ever wanted to appear online whilst away on a much more important task? I got you.
Have a boss that tracks your online time but workload does not require you to sit at your desk? I got you.


Repo Layout:
This repo is split into 2 areas, the code segment and the execution segment.

1. Code segment:
- Modifiable python script at your own descretion.

2. Execution segment:
- Compiled and packaged file via "pyinstaller". 
- To run the execution file, a "settings.txt" file needs to be in the same directory as the ".exe"
- settings.txt: has to include the start time, end time, and option of auto shutting down of the PC.

Notes:
- As of 29/10/24, I'm aware the script may not work with systems other than windows, I have no intention of making it compatible with other systems as of now.
- Further improvements may/may not be implemented based on laziness basis :3
